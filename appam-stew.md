# Aappam & Stew

We had Appam and Stew.
Suppose you want to have Appam for dinner at say 7PM


## Appam:


### Ingredients 

| Thing | Amount |
| --- | ---- |
| Rice | 1 cup |
| Cream of coconut milk | 1/2 cup |


### Instructions 

- Soak one cup of eating rice 12 hours before
- 6 hours before, grind finely. Don't worry about batter overheating. The priority is on fineness. 
- Take a ladle of this and boil with two ladles of water in a wok - you will get a thick paste. Blend this thick paste smoothly back into the batter.
- 2 Hours before you want to eat, add a spoon of sugar, half a cup of cream of coconut milk and a spoon of instant yeast to batter and await rise.
- At the time of eating, add salt and prepare appams. If you don't have a non stick just pour it on your dosa tava and do not spread it- you will get a nice spongy holey appam
- Batter thickness has to be adjusted- thick enough to get nice holes, thin enough to get lacy effects.
