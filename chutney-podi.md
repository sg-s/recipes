# Chutney Podi

##Ingredients 

| Thing | Amount |
| --- | ---- |
| Red Gram Dhall | 1 cup |
| Broken, skinned udad dhall | 1 cup |
| dry red chillies | 1 cup |
| tamarind | Large lime-sized |
| Copra | half | 
| Curry leaves | | 
| Salt | 2 tsp |
| Turmeric | 1 tsp |
| Mustard | 1 tsp |
| Hing | 1/4 tsp |
| Jaggery | 1/4 cup |

## Instructions 

- Roast red gram dal and udad dal separately in a kadhai over slow flame, till it changes colour, becomes aromatic, and is roasted through, so that when you bite it, it crumbles to powder in mouth and does not taste raw. 
- Roast chillies with a bit of oil till the chilli is crisp and easily crumbled
- The tamarind has to be separated by hand till it is shredded, and roasted in a bit of oil slowly till it becomes crisp. 
- Grate copra grated using long grater so you get long bits of copra. This is roasted separately without oil till is is light brown and fragrant, and crisp. 
- Roast curry leaves in a little oil till crisp
- Spread out all these roasted ingredients on a large tray, or paper, so they cool. 
- Splutter Mustard in oil
- First powder the dhalls, later add all other ingredients except jaggery and tamarind. 
- When still just half broken, you can sieve using the second smallest sieve in your collection. 
- If that is a bother, just keep powdering, and later add tamarind and jaggery, and curry leaves and spin to desired powder level.
